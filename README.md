# Ribbon-Creator
Ribbon Creator is a tool for Maya that will helps to create a ribbon rig with customizable parameters such as main joints, roll joints, length, align to selected joints, create deformers and others.

The ribbon is built to be :
- **Customizable** (with live parameters to preview the setup)
- **Easy to use / adapt**
- **Lightweight** (constraint-less, clean outliner)

Feel free to suggest changes and improvements !
